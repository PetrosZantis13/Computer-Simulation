# Computer_Simulation
The aim of this project was to simulate the motion of the planets in two-dimensions and to predict launch conditions for satellites to successfully reach planets.

Instructions to run simulation:

1. Please ensure that the files "Simulation.py" , "CelestialBody.py" and "planetDetails.txt", are in the same folder before running the simulation.

2. If yes, simply run the "Simulation.py" file, and provide a desired timestep value, in seconds. This value is recommended to be at around 3000 for a visually fast simulation, but for more accurate values it should be at around 900.

3. Enjoy the simulation! Observe the orbital period values being printed out on the console, as well as a total energy plot over time showing after the simulation is closed, in addition to a plot of the satellite distance from Earth over time.

4. An output file called "totalEnergy.txt", which contains the exact details of the energy plot, is also produced after the simulation is run.
